# 🎨 SimuSphere

SimuSphere is a **browser-based physics simulation** that recreates your uploaded image using thousands of animated spheres. Each sphere takes its color from the image, then moves, collides, and interacts under physics rules to form a dynamic visual reconstruction.  

➡️ **Live Demo:** [simusphere.vercel.app](https://simusphere.vercel.app)

## ✨ Features

- 📤 Upload any image (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.) and watch it recreated with spheres  
- ⚡ Real-time physics with **gravity, collision detection, bouncing, and constraints**  
- 📊 Live statistics panel: step count, object count, FPS, and simulation phase  
- 📈 Progress bar to track simulation stages (calculation → display)  
- 🖼 Export final simulation as a **high-resolution PNG image**  
- 🎨 Randomized sphere radii and smooth gradients for a 3D-like effect
